h1. SWS URL - SocialWebServer URL shortener

A quite simple Sinatra application for shortening urls. It cannot handle users and related stuff, so
its only usable on a webserver controlled by yourself.

To add urls quite comfortable, create a litte script like

bc. #!/bin/sh
ssh your.server.tld "chdir /path/to/sws/url/ && ./add_link.rb $1"

For even more convenience (and security!) use certificate (aka key) based ssh login.
